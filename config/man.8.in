.SH NAME
@PROJECT_TARGET@ \- fetch SSH keys from LDAP
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@PROJECT_TARGET@\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIusername\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB@PROGRAM_NAME@\fR is a small, configurable utility that will do a simple
LDAP query to retrieve a stored SSH key (typically stored in the \fIsshPublicKey\fR
attribute) for an SSH server to use to authenticate the user \fIusername\fR.
.PP
Typically this utility would be automatically invoked by the SSH
server by setting the SSH server to use \fB@PROGRAM_NAME@\fR as its
\fIAuthorizedKeysCommand\fR (see \fBsshd_config\fR(5)).
.PP
\fB@PROGRAM_NAME@\fR is configured through a configuration file
(see \fB@CONFIG_FILE@\fR(5)).
.PP
See the included README for information on configuring the LDAP server.
.SH OPTIONS
\fB@PROGRAM_NAME@\fR accepts the following options:
.TP
\fB\-\-config\fR \fIFILE\fR, \fB\-\-conf\fR\ \fIFILE\fR, \fB\-c\fR \fIFILE\fR
Loads the alternate configuration file \fIFILE\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR, \fB\-\-dbg\fR, \fB\-d\fR
Enable debugging mode.
\fB@PROGRAM_NAME@\fR will send verbose debugging messages to stderr.
\fB@PROGRAM_NAME@\fR will otherwise handle connections as usual.
.RS
This is functionally equivalent to setting \fIlog stdio\fR and \fIloglevel debug\fR
in the configuration file. This option is for debugging purposes only.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR, \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-v\fR, \fB\-?\fR
Display version information and help to stdout, then exit.
.TP
These options are not case-sensitive.
.SH FILES
\fI@CONFIG_PATH@/@CONFIG_FILE@\fR - the configuration file
(see \fB@CONFIG_FILE@\fR(5))
.SH OUTPUT
\fB@PROGRAM_NAME@\fR will only ever output the result attribute value to stdout (except when run with a variant of \fB\-\-help\fR, see above).
If a variant of \fB\-\-debug\fR is specified, or if \fIlog stdio\fR is set, \fB@PROGRAM_NAME@\fR will output those messages to stderr.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)
Successful program execution.
.TP
1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
The operation failed or the command arguments were not valid.
