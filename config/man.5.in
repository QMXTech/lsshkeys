.SH NAME
@CONFIG_FILE@ \- configuration file for @PROGRAM_NAME@.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file \fI@CONFIG_FILE@\fR contains the configuration information for running \fB@PROJECT_TARGET@\fR (see \fB@PROJECT_TARGET@\fR(8)).
The file contains configuration options, one per line, defining the method to fetch a single attribute (typically \fIsshPublicKey\fR) from an LDAP directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS "LOG OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBlog\fR \fISCHEME\fR | \fIFILE\fR
This option controls the way logging is done.

Log to syslog. This is the default setting.
.TP
.B stderr
Log to stderr.
.RE
.IP
\fIFILE\fR must be a path to a logfile
If \fIFILE\fR does not exist, \fIFILE\fR will be created.
If \fIFILE\fR already exists, \fIFILE\fR will be appended to.
